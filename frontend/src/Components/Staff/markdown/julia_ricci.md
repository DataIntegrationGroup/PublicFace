### Biography
I joined the New Mexico Geochronology Research Laboratory as a research scientist and the Argon lab manager.

As a specialist in argon geochronology, I bring an essential temporal constraint to the understanding of 
different geological processes and their evolution in time and space. Using mainly volcanology, my research
projects have combined geochronology with different fields such as paleomagnetism, geomorphology and geochemistry. 
Thus, among other things, I studied, the volcanic evolution of the active islands, but also the evolution of the 
magnetic field during the last 5 Ma with focus on the time constraint of the last Matuyama-Brunhes magnetic inversion. 
More recently, I have worked on the improvement of the 40Ar/39Ar dating of clay minerals in order to better constrain 
the medium and low-temperature processes characteristic of earth (sub-) surface: e.g. hydrothermal systems 
(geothermal energy, mineral resources), fault system paleo-activities.

Thus, through technical development, I strive to provide the most accurate temporal constraints possible.
