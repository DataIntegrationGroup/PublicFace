### Biography
I am the principal developer and maintainer for pychron, a data collection and processing application for noble gas 
geochronology and geochemistry. I am interested in pushing the boundaries of noble gas geochronology via advances in
software and hardware. My research focuses on developing software and hardware interfaces to facilitate and ease noble 
gas experimentation. However, recently I have shifted focus from geochronology to using small Unmanned Aerial Systems 
(sUAS) for geoscience. The sUAS platforms we are developing are used for a variety of purposes, including generating
detailed orthomosaics and 3D models, and collecting high-resolution thermal images and georeferenced environmental data.

In addition to my research at the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and the New Mexico Geochronology Research Laboratory, 
I work with two Hydrology groups on campus: 1) the NM Aquifer Mapping program developing data processing software 
tools and 2) the NMT EES Hydrology department mentoring students on scientific programming.
